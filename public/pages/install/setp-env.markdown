## [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon

Setting up the web application environment variables for [Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon).

## Configuring Environment Variables
Environment variables can be configured by [exporting variables](#using-command-line) to your terminal
from which you'll be running Threat Dragon, or by using a  `.env` [local file](#using-dotenv).

### Values for the environment variables

* In your github account, go to `Settings -> 'Developer settings' -> 'OAuth Apps' -> 'New OAuth App'`

* fill out the form with the following:
1. **Application name**: not critical, suggest something like 'Threat Dragon'
1. **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
1. **Application description**: not critical, for example 'Threat Dragon local development'
1. **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/oauth/github`

* Register the application, an example screenshot [is shown below](#example-oauth-registration).

* In this new OAuth App, note the values for the 20 character long Client ID (used here `01234567890123456789`)
and the 40 character long Client Secret (used here `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567`)

* Generate a random 32 character hexadecimal key (something like `11223344556677889900aabbccddeeff`)

You now have all the info to set up the environment variables.

### Using Dotenv
If you are using dotenv then place a file named `.env` at the root of the project with your environment variables.
An `example.env` is provided as a reference.
Threat Dragon will then load any variables in this file as environment variables,
and you do not need to setup the environment variables [from the command line](#using-command-line).

### Using Command line
If you are not using [dotenv](#using-dotenv), then the environment variables can be set from the command line.

#### MacOS / Linux
For MacOS and Linux go into the terminal from which you start Threat Dragon and enter at the
command line:
* GITHUB_CLIENT_ID from Client ID above,
for example `export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=01234567890123456789`
* GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET from Client Secret above,
for example `export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567`
* `export NODE_ENV=development`
* `export SESSION_STORE=local`
* SESSION_SIGNING_KEY as the random 32 character hexadecimal key,
for example `export SESSION_SIGNING_KEY=11223344556677889900aabbccddeeff`
* SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEYS has the same 32 character key,
for example `export SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEYS='[{"isPrimary": true, "id": 0, "value": "11223344556677889900aabbccddeeff"}]'`
* GITHUB_SCOPE - set this to `repo` if you want access also to private repos

Note that we are suing the example values for these variables, and the values obtained in 
the 'Values for the environment variables' section **must** be used instead.

#### Windows
Similarly for Windows, from the terminal used to start Threat Dragon enter at the
command line:
* `set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=01234567890123456789`
* `set GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567`
* `set NODE_ENV=development`
* `set SESSION_STORE=local`
* `set SESSION_SIGNING_KEY=11223344556677889900aabbccddeeff`
* `set SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEYS='[{"isPrimary": true, "id": 0, "value": "11223344556677889900aabbccddeeff"}]'`

Note that we are suing the example values for these variables, and the values obtained in 
the 'Values for the environment variables' section **must** be used instead.

## Check it is running
You should now be able to start Threat Dragon web application using `npm start`
and then navigate in a browser to "http://localhost:3000/"
