## [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon

Threat Dragon can be run from the command line and there is a command line interface
which can be used to access some Threat Dragon features.

### Run Threat Dragon from the command line
With the desktop version of [Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) installed,
and if the executable is in the environment path, then Threat Dragon can be run from the command line.

For example on MacOS and Linux:

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon`

or after installing on Windows:

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon.exe`

AppImage does not need installation, so after downloading version 1.3.1 (for example) just run:

`./OWASP-Threat-Dragon-1.3.1.AppImage`

### Threat Dragon command line interface
The command line interface can be used to directly access some of Threat Dragon's functionality.

Ensure that the executable is in the environment path and run this command to get help :

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon --help`

A threat model file can be exported to pdf :

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon --pdf ./threat-model.json --verbose`

Or for Windows:

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon.exe --pdf .\threat-model.json --verbose`

or using AppImage (using version 1.3.1 for example):

`./OWASP-Threat-Dragon-1.3.1.AppImage --pdf ./threat-model.json --verbose`

*Note* that the path to the JSON file needs to be resolvable, so use the full path
or the './' if the file is in the working directory.

Here is the help contents for version 1.3.1 :

```
OWASP-Threat-Dragon --help
