## [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon

Future versions of [Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) should provide an 
application programming interface to support CI/CD pipleines and the like. At present it 
provides a very minimal application programming interface, but this is being worked on.

Notional ideas for this API are:
* provide pdf output
* list unmitigated threats
* list mitigated threats
* statistics
