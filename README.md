This repo provides the [documentation site](https://threatdragon.github.io)
for Threat Dragon up to version 1.6.0.
The latest version 1.6.1 documentation is now on the [OWASP project site][docsv1].

[Mike Goodwin](https://github.com/mike-goodwin) created Threat Dragon as an open source community project
that provides an intuitive and accessible way to model threats.

Threat Dragon is a threat modelling application which provides model diagramming and a rule engine to auto-generate threats/mitigations. 
Threat Dragon is an [OWASP Lab Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/) run by volunteers.
There is always plenty to do so please contribute your ideas and time if you can.
